# PuttyKeyCrack
A powerful brute-force tool designed specifically for decrypting Solar-PuTTY .dat files. It uses dynamic password generation based on user-defined patterns and supports multithreading for maximum efficiency. Perfect for penetration testers and cybersecurity enthusiasts looking to recover credentials from encrypted session backups.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Password Generation**: Supports custom base patterns with dynamic parts (e.g., `est**`).
- **Multithreading**: Utilizes multiple threads to maximize brute-force speed.
- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Displays attempts, speed, and estimated remaining time.
- **Targeted for `.dat` Files**: Specifically designed for decrypting Solar-PuTTY session backups.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or newer
- Dependencies:
  - `pycryptodome` (install with `pip install pycryptodome`)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pycryptodome
   ```

---

## Usage

Run the script with the following options:

 ```bash
python puttykeycrack.py --file FILE --pattern PATTERN [--dynamic-length DYNAMIC_LENGTH] [--threads THREADS]
   ```
### Arguments

 ```bash
--file: Path to the .dat file to decrypt (required).
--pattern: Base pattern of the password, using ** as the dynamic part (required).
--dynamic-length: Length of the dynamic part to replace ** (default is 4).
--threads: Number of threads to use for brute-forcing (default is 4).
   ```

## Examples

1. Basic Usage
   
Decrypt a file with a base pattern and default settings:

 ```bash
python brute_force.py --file sessions-backup.dat --pattern "est**"
   ```

2. Custom Dynamic Length
   
Set the dynamic part of the password to 6 characters:

 ```bash
python brute_force.py --file sessions-backup.dat --pattern "est**" --dynamic-length 6
   ```

3. Multithreading

Use 8 threads for faster processing:

```bash
python brute_force.py --file sessions-backup.dat --pattern "est**" --threads 8
```

## Output

While running, SolarBrute shows real-time progress:

```bash
Generating dynamic combinations of length 4...
Starting 8 threads...
Progress: 3456/1679616 (0.21%) | Speed: 453.21 attempts/sec | Remaining time: 3564.45s
```

If a password is found:

```bash
Password found!: est**
{"Username":"root","Password":"est**"}
Process completed successfully.
```

If no password is found:

```bash
Password not found. Try different parameters.
```

## Limitations

- Only works with .dat files generated by Solar-PuTTY.
- The script assumes a known base pattern with dynamic parts.
- Password cracking speed depends on the system's processing power.
